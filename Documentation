"Privacy is the foundation of all freedoms. Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing
to hide is like saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say." - Edward Snowden

\\\\\WHAT IS DA-CHAT?\\\\\

THOTH is crypto's first protocol that utilizes the internal cryptography in Ethereum's VM to bind 
real world parties to legally binding agreements. Launched initially on CANTO thanks to the CANTO 
Hackathon, THOTH allows two (or more) parties to bind themselves into a legal agreement that includes
terms that cannot be directly included in smart contracts because of their size, uncertainty, or 
incompatibility with the EVM.

Users can bring any contract in PDF form to THOTH to be bound. This can be provided by one party's 
lawyer, custom written by the parties, or selected from an external legal repository such as OpenLaw 
(https://www.openlaw.io/).

Ultimately, THOTH uploads the agreement to IPFS, and prompts the signatories to execute the agreement. 
Once all parties sign, the agreement is fully executed and is marked as such on chain.

<b>THOTH and its developers can provide no legal advice or opinions as to the legality of any contracts 
  agreed to and executed on THOTH. Use of and reliance of THOTH is entirely at the user's risk.</b>

THOTH's development front-end is available at <i>https://zodomo-thoth.surge.sh/ </i> or 
<i>https://thoth-ui.vercel.app/</i> depending on our mood.
